# DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT - INVESTMENT CONSULTING - S&P 500

## Theme

A company that wants to invest in the stock market seeks us to do a data analysis for them, since they have no experience with these markets and have never invested.

For this we will base ourselves on the S&P500 index, this is one of the most famous stock market indices in the United States and the world, it is also considered the most representative index of the real market situation.

Anyone can invest in this index, so we will recommend to this company to invest in the index, what times are ideal to enter the market, what the methodology will be and the reason for our explanation.

For this we will use PowerBI, where with a Dashboard we will show the information collected and present our methodology.
