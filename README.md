# INVESTMENT CONSULTING - S&P 500


A company wants to invest in the stock market and seeks us to do a data analysis for them, since they have no experience with these markets and have never invested.

For this we will base ourselves on the S&P500 index, this is one of the most famous stock market indices in the United States and in the world, it is also considered the most representative index of the real market situation.

Anyone can invest in this index, so we will recommend to this company to invest in the index, what times are ideal to enter the market, what the methodology will be and the reason for our explanation.

For this I will use PowerBI and with a Dashboard we will show the information collected and present our methodology.

### Methodology

* I used Python libraries like Pandas, numpy and seaborn to do an EDA (Exploratory data analysis), get familiar with indices like SP500, NASDAQ and BITCOIN and get the final datasets
* Uploaded the final datasets to POWER BI and made a Dashboard to explain the analysis, using KPIs, important metrics and final conclusions so the company

### Final Conclusions
In conclusion we have several indicators with which we can make the decision to enter the market.

- Discount from Maximums: Currently the index has discounted 25% from its previous maximum, it is a good point to enter but it is advisable to wait for 30% since historically it has shown that it is a better entry point
- VIX Volatility: this index shows us how volatile the market is and what the “sentiment” of investors is, so if it reaches 30 it can be interpreted as the price being well positioned enough to enter.
- BITCOIN and NASDAQ: I advise looking at the prices of bitcoin and the NASDAQ index and relating them to the SP500 since this index is mostly made up of technological stocks so it will replicate what the other two do and have a better context of the actual situation

Here you can see a picture of the final Dashboard
